Therefore, infants are provided with a specific dose of vitamin C at birth to avoid bleeding cases.\nWarning: Studies have shown that the absorption of vitamin K may decrease when taken with other fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin E and vitamin D, so it is recommended to have an interval of at least two hours between these vitamins to increase their level of absorption.",
